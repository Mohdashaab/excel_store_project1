# excel_store_project1

Hello Connections❗,
I am very excited to share my first step 🎯 toward the data analyst 📈
This is an Excel-based data visualization project.

In this project, I analyze a vrinda store data and made MIS charts to understand easily.

✅The project also answered important questions such as: -
- How do sales and orders compare using a single chart?
- Which month had the highest sales and orders?
- Who purchased more, men or women in 2022?
- What are different order statuses in 2022?
- Which are the top 5 states contributing to sales?
- What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?

📈 Based on the report Insights :
⭐ Women are more likely to purchase (65%) than men.
⭐ In the month of March the store achieved the highest sales.
⭐Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh Telangana and Tamil Nadu were the top contributors to sales (35%).
⭐ The adult age group (30-49 yrs.) made the most contributions (50%).
⭐ Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels were the top contributors (80%).

🎯 The final conclusion to improve store sales is to target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs.) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.✌
